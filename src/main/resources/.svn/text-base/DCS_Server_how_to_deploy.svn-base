instructions on how to deploy to DCS server:
===========================================================================================
well... good news:
I was right and my supposition worked out very well :)
After fixing the issues I posted before, now it's deployed perfectly! Link on DCS is:

http://bourbon:38007/ElectronicJournal/

-Webapp log can be found at:

/usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.39/logs/catalina.out (in the virtual server)

-I've made the deployment super easy now, and here are the steps to deploy if you guys need to:

.go to ( http://bourbon:38007/manager/ ) [this is the link for tomcat manager]
.login as un: geo , pw: geo
.go to 'Manage apps' or maybe you be already on the screen called 'Tomcat Web Application Manager'
.press 'Undeploy' button on the table row with our webapp name
.go down and 'select WAR file to deploy' (after exporting our project to .war)
.upload, and that's all! (you can choose the file in your local machine)
.reload and see it working.

additional details:
i created a script for the virtual server, you can use 'putty' app to connect to it, and run the following commands if needed:
'tomcat start'
'tomcat stop'

to access the university network from home, follow these instructions:

don't forget to change hibernate from 'create' to 'update' if don't want to re-create DB every time deployed.
===========================================================================================
stuff i had to do -just to remember next time we deploy- :

ref: https://guide.dcs.shef.ac.uk/Teachnet/VirtualMachines

0.1- open putty, connect to: bourbon:30007 , using SSH:
un: root
pw: ymu5nwrl

0.2- DCS MySQL database:
host: stusql.dcs.shef.ac.uk
un: team098
pw: 16b22826
---------don't forget to put /databasename after host!

0.3- see system.out of your web app in tomcat/logs/catalina.out

0.4- edit tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml (or sth like that) to add new manager,admin role to some un:pw.
after that, go to localhost:8080/manager or whatever/manager, and manage your webapps or upload a .war file.

1- export .war file
2- move to /usr/share/~tomcat~/webapp/ using 'WinSCP' software
3- rename .war file if didnt generate the folder remotely
4- edit /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file, add at the end entries:
JkMount /com6514stageone worker
JkMount /com6514stageone/* worker
!!!!!IMPORTANT::: add the exact name of the folder... if you deploy as ElectronicJournal, so, add this:
JkMount /ElectronicJournal worker
JkMount /ElectronicJournal/* worker

5- save file, stop/start httpd server via 'PuTTy' software:
apachectl stop
apachectl start

6- stop/start tomcat if needed:
service tomcat stop
service tomcat start
//its possible because i created a script following one of the links i sent u before.

7- access your webapp using the url: http://bourbon:38007/com6514stageone/

Done!
